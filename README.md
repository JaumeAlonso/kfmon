# What's it for?

This is intended as an improvement over [Sergey](https://github.com/sergeyvl/vlasovsoft/tree/master/fmon)'s [Kobo File Monitor](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218283). If you're unfamiliar with fmon, it basically launches a specific action when you open a specific book on your Kobo, thanks to Linux's ```inotify``` API. Usually, a single PNG file is used as the "trigger" book.

The original fmon does zero sanity checking, and, given the intricacies of how Nickel actually processes books, it might trigger an action *before* the trigger file has successfully been processed by Nickel. Depending on the action in question, this might lead to fun boot loops or other weirdness ;).

KFMon tries to alleviate this issue by doing a number of checks before deeming that launching the action is "safe": we first check if the file in question is even *in* the Library database, and then we confirm that it has been processed further by checking for the existence of the various thumbnails Nickel creates when first displaying a book in its Library and Homescreen.

On top of that, we have a few extra features: instead of launching one instance per book/action pair, KFMon is a centralized daemon, which simply parses a number of simple INI config files. Each book/action pair gets a dedicated config file.

~~It's also integrated in the Kobo boot process in an unobtrusive manner (an udev hook), unlike fmon (which modifies a startup script).~~ (See [Issue #2](NiLuJe/kfmon/issues/2) for the various troubles that caused us ;)).

And it also properly persists across unmounts & remounts (like during an USBMS export).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Some of these checks requires a decently recent enough Nickel version. Make sure you're running a firmware version equal to or newer than 2.9.0!

**NOTE**: If you're just looking for a drop-in replacement of Sergey's fmon, check out [Baskerville](https://github.com/baskerville/fmon)'s implementation of fmon, which should be saner & safer than Sergey's original, while following the same general principles.

# How do I install this?

First, if you're currently using fmon, it might be a good idea to uninstall it first ;). Since both patch the same startup script, only the last one you installed will actually "take".
Then, head over to the [dedicated MobileRead thread](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=274231), and simply unpack the ZIP archive to the USB root of your Kobo when it's plugged to a computer.
The package contains an example config to launch [KOReader](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=276) if it is already installed, as well as a ```KoboRoot.tgz``` which will actually install KFMon itself.
This ensures that the KOReader PNG file will first be processed by Nickel before the KoboRoot package triggers a reboot for installation.

# How can I tinker with it?

The config files are stored in the */mnt/onboard/*__.adds/kfmon/config__ folder.

KFMon itself has a dedicated config file, [kfmon.ini](/config/kfmon.ini), with two knobs:

```db_timeout = 450```, which sets the maximum amount of time (in ms) we wait for Nickel to relinquish its hold on its database when we try to access it ourselves. If the timeout expires, KFMon assumes that Nickel is busy, and will *NOT* launch the action.
This default value (450ms) has been successfully tested on a moderately sized Library, but if stuff appears to be failing to launch (after ~10s) on your device, and you have an extensive or complex Library, try increasing this value.
You can confirm KFMon's behavior by checking its log, which we'll come to presently.

```use_syslog = 0```, which dictates whether KFMon logs to a dedicated log file (located in */usr/local/kfmon/kfmon.log*), or to the syslog (which you can access via the *logread* tool on the Kobo). Might be useful if you're paranoid about flash wear. Disabled by default. Be aware that the log file will be trimmed if it grows over 1MB.

# How can I add my own actions?

Each action gets a [dedicated INI file](/config/koreader.ini) in the config folder, so just drop a new ```.ini``` in the config folder.
This should make it trivial to port existing fmon setups.
As you would expect, a simple file/action pair only requires two entries:

```filename = /mnt/onboard/my_pretty_icon.png```, which points to the "book" file you want to tie your action to. In this example, it's a simple PNG file named ```my_pretty_icon.png``` located at the USB root of the device. This has to be an absolute path, and, of course, has to point to a location Nickel will parse (i.e., not the rootfs, and not nested in a dotfolder).

```action = /mnt/onboard/.adds/mycoolapp/app.sh```, which points to the binary/script you want to trigger when your "book" is opened. This has to be an absolute path. And if this points to somewhere on the rootfs, it has to have the exec bit set.

Note that the section all these key/value pairs fall under *has* to be named ```[watch]```!


In addition to that, you can try to do some cool stuff with the Nickel database: updating the Title, Author and Comment entries of your "book" in the Library.
This is disabled by default, because ninja writing to the database behind Nickel's back *might* upset Nickel (meaning thrash your db!)...
If you want to try it, you will have to first enable this knob:

```do_db_update = 1```

And you will have to set *all three* of the following key/value pairs:

```db_title = My Cool App```, which sets the Title of your "book" in the Library.

```db_author = An Awesome Team```, which sets the Author of your "book" in the Library.

```db_comment = A cool app that does neat stuff made by an awesome team.```, which sets the Comment shown in the "Details" panel of the "book" in the Library.

Note that these three fields will be cropped at 128 characters.

# How do I install this?

You'll havbe to delete a few things manually, ideally over SSH:

The file ```/etc/udev/rules.d/99-kfmon.rules``` (which may not exist anymore, depending on which version of KFMon you were running).

And the folders ```/usr/local/kfmon``` & ```/mnt/onboard/.adds/kfmon```.

Optionally, you might also want to restore a vanilla version of ```/etc/init.d/on-animator.sh``` (f.g., [commit 8710a31](NiLuJe/kfmon/commit/8710a31d2e6d998ba315bafff37fd4ba8d1cc7a1) features one such version).

# Things to watch out for

KFMon will abort if any of the watched files cannot be found when it starts up.
KFMon will only parse config files at boot.

Meaning you will need to reboot your device after adding new config files or modifying or removing existing ones ;).
If it's a new config file, try to make sure it points to a file that has already been processed by Nickel (after an USBMS plug/eject session, for instance) to save you some puzzlement ;).

If you delete one of the files being watched, don't forget to delete the matching config file, and then to reboot your device!

Due to the exact timing at which Nickel parses books, for a completely new file, the first action might only be triggered the first time the book is *closed*, instead of opened (i.e., the moment the "Last Book Opened" tile is generated and shown on the Homescreen).

Note that right now, proper interaction with KOReader requires a bleeding-edge version of KOReader (i.e., current nightlies or OTAs, not the stable version).

Right now, KFMon supports a maximum of [16](/kfmon.h#L104) file watches. Ping me if that's not enough for you ;).
